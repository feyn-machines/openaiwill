"""Whether anything published has moved a gate, and a dated record either way.

A gate is closed by definition - that is what makes it a gate - so the useful
question is never "is it closed?" but "has anything changed it, and when did we
last look?". A gate with no state row is indistinguishable from a gate nobody
has checked; a row saying "closed, nothing in this window moved it, as of this
date" is a finding.

Only policy statements are read here. A gate lifts when an institution changes
its rules, not when a model gets better, so a benchmark result is not evidence
about a gate no matter how strong it is.
