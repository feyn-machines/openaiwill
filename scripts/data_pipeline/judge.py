"""Typed judgment over (work, capability) pairs, with two interchangeable backends.

Why this exists: `requires` edges cannot be produced by matching words. Searching
18,838 O*NET task texts for "software" returns 999 hits across 362 occupations,
but every one of the 14 hits under oaw:occupation:11-9032.00 (education
administrators) is a false positive - there "program" means a course of study and
"code" means a section of regulation. The edge is a judgment, so it needs a judge,
a rubric, and a recorded provenance for every answer.

Both backends answer the same question and write the same row shape, so their
disagreement is measurable rather than a matter of opinion. Nothing here writes a
reviewed edge: every result lands as ai_proposed + candidate.
