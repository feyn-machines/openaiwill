"""Route one AI update to the work it bears on, and say how far it goes.

This is the only step whose cost follows the world rather than the catalogue.
The catalogue is static — which occupations do a market's work, which tasks an
activity covers, which gates hold it — and was built once. What changes is that
about nineteen updates arrive per day, and each one has to find its way to the
activities it says something about.

Two calls per update:

  1. Which of the 614 activities does this update bear on? Batched under the
     request ceiling, asked as independent yes/no so a certainty and an explicit
     negative survive.
  2. For the ones it does: what tier is the claim, and how much did a person
     still do?

The old chain asked this through capabilities and lost it: a flagship legal
product was judged against forty-six capabilities, none of which was legal work,
and produced nothing. Asked directly against "Legal document drafting and
checking", it lands.
