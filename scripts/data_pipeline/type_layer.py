"""Seed the gate type layer and the organisation registry.

Definitions come from datasets/semantic/gates.v1.json and the vocabulary that
governs them comes from the semantic model; this module only projects them into
PostgreSQL. Re-running with the same model is a no-op; re-running after the
model changed is an error, because a seeded row that silently changed meaning is
worse than a failed run.

Capabilities were seeded here too, along with their candidate edges. The layer
is retired: forty-one of the forty-six matched every kind of work, so it
answered every question with the same answer. Gates stayed, because a gate is
not a weak capability - it is a condition that does not lift when models
improve, and it is what holds an activity at L0 whatever the evidence says.
