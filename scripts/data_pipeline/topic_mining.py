"""Topics: the standing questions a day's posts argue about.

An update is something that happened once. A topic is a closed question about
one occupation or one market - "does the job of prompt engineer still exist?" -
that stays open while claims and updates collect under its answers.

Mining reads a window of posts in two passes:

1. Every post by a person or a third-party organisation is read for a claim:
   which job or business it is about, which kind of question it answers, and
   the answer its author asserts. Most posts make no such claim.
2. Claims are taken in the order they were posted. Each is put under an answer
   of a topic that is already open, or opens a new topic, or is left out as too
   vague to be a question. A day gives claims; topics are what they add up to.

Whether a claim belongs to an open topic is a judgment, not a key: "accountant"
and "junior accountant" are one question, "prompt engineer" and "junior
developer" are two although the catalog puts both under software developers. A
local embedding shortlists the few open topics and catalog entries worth
showing the judge; the score itself decides nothing.

The accounts we collect lean one way, so most topics arrive with every claim on
one side. Such a topic is `one_sided`: the answer nobody argued is written out,
with search phrases aimed at it. It is what a search goes looking for next.

Nothing here decides an answer. A count of accounts under an option says who
argued it in the posts we collected, not how many people think so.

Topics, their answers and the claims under them are rows in PostgreSQL
(ontology schema 2.3.0); each run also leaves a document under data/ that is
never overwritten. Read by calendar quarter, a topic shows how the argument
moved; no outcome is ever declared (rule:topic-carries-no-answer).

replacement - whether AI does, or will do, the work of a specific job or a specific kind of work, so that the job shrinks, changes into something else, or disappears. The object is that job or kind of work (for example "prompt engineer", "junior software engineer", "radiologist", "customer support agent").

viability - whether a specific kind of product or business is still worth building or paying for now that AI can do it. The object is that kind of product or business (for example "AI wrapper apps", "indie SaaS products", "translation agencies", "game studios").

The object is always human work or a business - never an AI model or tool. One model being better or worse than another, or one tool replacing another tool, is not a claim of either kind.

A post counts only when its author asserts an answer about a SPECIFIC object. Leave a post out when it is news of a release, a benchmark number with no conclusion about a job or business, a joke, a reaction, an advertisement, a general remark about AI, society, intelligence or "the future of work", or about a whole discipline, "knowledge workers" or "everyone".

Return JSON: {"claims": [{"id": the post id, "question_type": "replacement" or "viability", "object": the job or kind of business in a few plain English words (singular, lower case, no adjectives of opinion), "claim": one sentence in English stating what the author asserts about that object, without naming the author, "quote": the words of the post, copied exactly and in its own language, that carry the assertion (one sentence or less)}]}.

You are given one new claim an account made, the open topics most like it, and catalog entries it might belong to. Decide what to do with the claim.

"attach" - the claim answers the question of one of the open topics. Prefer this whenever it honestly fits: the same question must not be opened twice. The object must be the same thing at the level the question is asked: "junior accountant" answers a question about accountants, and "SaaS apps" or "professional software" answer a question about whether selling software is still a business; "prompt engineer" does not answer a question about software developers, it is a different job. Say which answer the claim takes. If it takes a position none of the answers covers and the topic has fewer than 4 answers, write that answer as "new_option"; otherwise pick the nearest answer.

"new" - no open topic asks what this claim answers. Write the topic:
- It names the specific object.
- One short question of at most 15 words that a reader answers by picking an option, in the plain form people ask it: "Will AI replace most accountants?", "Does the job of prompt engineer still exist?", "Is selling software still a viable business?". Never "what happens to X when ...", "what does X mean for Y", "how will X change", "which X first", and no conditions or lists inside the question.

- Later evidence (a measured result, a real deployment, a failure) could favour one option.

- "catalog_id": the ONE catalog entry that is this thing or clearly contains it - an occupation for a job, a market for a business - or null when none is. A wrong match is worse than none.
- Check it honestly: "specific" (one job or one kind of business, not a field), "closed", "exclusive", "movable".

"none" - the claim is too vague to be a question of this kind, or its object is not a job people hold or a business people run (a programming language, a tool, a habit, a way of working, a hiring practice are none of these; a line of work people are hired for, such as prompt engineering or video editing, IS a job).
