"""DeepSeek extraction call — the one non-deterministic step of event extraction.

DeepSeek exposes an OpenAI-compatible chat/completions endpoint, so this stays a
thin stdlib HTTP client (no new dependency). The API key is infrastructure and
lives in the environment (DEEPSEEK_API_KEY), never in the pool file, the skill, a
committed file or NEXT_PUBLIC. Model and endpoint are overridable via
DEEPSEEK_MODEL / DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL. The prompt is versioned by its SHA-256 so a
prompt change is visible in every extraction run's provenance.
