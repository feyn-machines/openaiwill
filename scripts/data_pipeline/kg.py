"""Published data as versioned, immutable releases in the `kg` schema.

The published snapshot (nine JSON files) is stored row by row. A row's body is
content-addressed in kg.docs, so a release that changes 30 of 20,000 rows writes
30 documents; kg.release_rows says which documents make up which release.
Importing never touches anything outside `kg`, so later user data in the same
database is never disturbed by a data update.

The one guarantee that matters: a release becomes `verified` only after the
payload has been reassembled *from the database* and hashed with the pipeline's
own `digest`, and the result equals the manifest's `content_sha256`.

This module does not import psycopg at module level: its pure parts (pack,
unpack, release_id, diff_rows) are unit-tested with the system python.
