"""Attention: how much notice an update drew (rule:attention-baseline).

Kept strictly apart from capability. A like is not evidence that AI can do
anything (the project's evidence rules forbid capability points for
engagement), so nothing in this module is read by any level computation. It
decides what is worth a reader's attention and which updates are important
enough to go looking for third-party verification.

Ranked by engagement, not views: ranked by views against the account's own
median, the top ten were paid promotions - thousands of times an account's
usual views and almost no likes. Engagement takes a person to click. The
multiple of the account's median engagement is kept alongside, and every post
is read at day 7 (rule:attention-baseline: two captures, first seen and day 7);
before day 7 the number is provisional.
