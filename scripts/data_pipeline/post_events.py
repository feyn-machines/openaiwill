"""Which posts belong to which event (rule:post-links-to-event).

Posts are related, not accounts classified. An event is extracted from some
official posts; everything that answers, quotes or reposts those posts - and
whatever answers those in turn - belongs to the same event, found by walking
the upstream links kept on collected_sources. These links are facts in the raw
data, so this step judges nothing. A post with no upstream that names the
product in the week after the event is a weaker `mention`, whose content the
judge still has to confirm.

event_posts is derived and rebuilt in full; nothing here is edited in place.
